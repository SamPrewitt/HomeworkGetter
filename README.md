# HomeworkGetter
Selenium WebDriver is used to log into my University's website, retrieve my upcoming homework assignments, and then place them into Google Calendar. 
**Newly REDUNDANT DUE TO USE OF 2-Factor Authentication :(**

Mainly used for practice working with GIT and making my own projects from scratch (even if this is very simple).
